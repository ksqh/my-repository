A easy repository
Hello everyone.
Im a college student.The programming language I have learned are C and C++.In addition,I also know several data structures.
I don't have much experience in programming.The reason why I joined Github is to understand programming better.
For a specific problem,as long as I can do it,I will do a good job.
Looking forward to communicating and cooperating with everyone.
